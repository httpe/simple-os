# Simple-OS

Simple-OS is a (rather basic) hobbyist operating system for x86-32bit platform. The target is to create a self-hosting operating system, i.e. one can compile Simple-OS in itself.

## Current Status & Goal

Although the final goal is to make the system self-hosting, we have planned for several practical milestone:

1. **Milestone One: Bootloader**
    Many of the existing tutorials rely on GRUB to boot the system and do some initialize (like entering Protected Mode), which we don't like. For educational purpose, we want to fully control everything, starting from booting the system. Therefore, we choose to implement a standalone bootloader as our first step.
    - Enter 32-bit protected mode and do various initialize before passing control to the kernel
    - Provide disk I/O routines and a (read-only) file system to host the kernel
    - Able to parse and load a ELF kernel written in C
    - Provide basic printing utilities for debugging
    - Code should be self-contained, i.e. no external dependency.
    - **Finished**: Implemented under the folder `bootloader`

1. **Milestone Two: Kernel with Input and Output**
    - Write in C, compile to a [Multiboot](https://wiki.osdev.org/Multiboot) ELF kernel file
    - Initialize [IDT](https://wiki.osdev.org/IDT) and [ISR](https://wiki.osdev.org/ISR)
    - Enable [Paging](https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging) and [Higher Half Kernel](https://wiki.osdev.org/Higher_Half_x86_Bare_Bones)
    - Support `printf` to write various type of data as string to the screen
    - Support reading user input from keyboard
    - After initialization, run a program that user can enter some text to the screen and edit/delete it
    - **Finished**: Implemented under the folder `kernel`

1. **Milestone Three: Memory Management, User Space and Multiprocessing**
    - Implement a [heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#HEAP) to do [dynamic memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation)
    - Allow switch to user space and run ELF program under user/ring3 privilege
    - Enable multi-processing with independent kernel stack and page directory, starting with [Cooperative Scheduling](https://littleosbook.github.io/#cooperative-scheduling-with-yielding) and then [Preemptive Scheduling](https://littleosbook.github.io/#preemptive-scheduling-with-interrupts)
    - Implement `fork`, `exec` and `yield` system calls on a simple read-only file system (potentially reuse the USTAR code from the bootloader)
    - **Finished**:
      - Kernel heap
      - ELF loader
      - Cooperative and preemptive multi-tasking (single CPU, synchronized by disabling interrupt when doing system call)
      - Exec system call based on the USTAR read-only file system

1. **Milestone Four: Filesystem, Libc and Hosted Tool-chain**
    - Provide a readable & writable file system (FAT or Ext) and corresponding system calls
    - Build user space standard C library with system calls, e.g. printf, malloc and open/read/write. Potentially port [Newlib](https://wiki.osdev.org/Porting_Newlib) as our standard C library.

## Docker Image

You can either follow the instructions below to install dependencies and build, or directly build a docker image using our `Dockerfile`.

```bash
docker build -t simple-os/final:local .
```

This might take 30+ minutes.

To run Simple-OS (in WSL Linux):

```bash
docker run --rm -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY -it simple-os/final:local
```

## Dependencies

1. [NASM Assembler](https://www.nasm.us/).

2. [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) Emulator: We will use QEMU to emulate our system, avoiding restarting computer again and again just to test the system.

3. System wide GCC & Binutils toolchain: We will need them to [compile a cross-compiler](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) and build our [OS specific toolchain](https://wiki.osdev.org/OS_Specific_Toolchain) at next step.

    Installing 1-3 on `Ubuntu`:

    ```bash
        sudo apt -y update
        sudo apt -y install build-essential autoconf automake git
        sudo apt -y install bison flex libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev texinfo libisl-dev curl
        sudo apt -y install gcc-multilib
        sudo apt -y install qemu-system-x86 nasm
        sudo apt -y install dosfstools xterm
    ```

    Installing 1-3 on `Arch Linux`:

    ```bash
        sudo pacman -Syy
        sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel gmp libmpc mpfr
        sudo pacman -S --needed git qemu qemu-arch-extra nasm
    ```

4. Hosted GCC & Binutils and Newlib for Simple-OS: We will need this specialized tool-chain and Newlib to compile those user space programs including init and shell.

    To build the cross-compiler and our OS specific tool-chain, you can use the script `build-toolchain.sh`. It will run for 30 - 45 minutes depending on your machine's spec. Based on our experience, at least 4GB ram is required in building GCC and 8GB is recommended. Also, please prepare around 10GB of free disk space to hold all the intermediate files generated in the building process.

5. (Optional) [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): We provide some integration of the building/debugging process with VSCode, but it is optional. Some extension may also be needed as described in the `Debug` section below.

## Build

### Configure

If your tool-chain is built by the `build-toolchain.sh` script, you can skip this section. The default values should work automatically. Otherwise, please still use `build-toolchain.sh` as a reference.

Build environment variables are set up in `config.sh`:

- `CROSSCOMPILERBIN`: Point it to the folder containing the cross-compiling GCC/Binutils binaries (see *Dependencies* section).
- `AS`: Point to the system wide NASM assembler, if not set, `nasm` is used.
- `TOOL_CHAIN_ROOT`: Point to the location holding the Simple-OS hosted tool-chain and Newlib

### Compile

Once you have the cross-compiler and hosted tool-chain ready, you can **build** Simple-OS by running:

```bash
./clean.sh
./build.sh
```

If compile finish successfully, `bootable_kernel.bin` will be generated under the source root dir.

### Emulate

You can test run the compiled kernel by QEMU:

```bash
./qemu.sh
```

Anything written to the serial port (all outputs to the screen will be copied to the serial port by the kernel) will be logged into `serial_port_output.txt`. Kernel debug info will also be available through the the file.

The script also check if there is a `testfs.fat` image file under root dir, if so, it will mount it through the `-hdb` argument when starting QEMU. This file should be a hard disk image of a FAT-32 file system. Simple-OS will try to mount it under `/home`.

For testing purpose, you can use the [FAT32 image]([testfs.fat.tar](https://github.com/aroulin/FAT32-FS-Driver/blob/master/testfs.fat.tar?raw=true)) provided by the [FAT32-FS-Driver](https://github.com/aroulin/FAT32-FS-Driver) project. Or simply generate an empty FAT32 image (512MiB) by:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=testfs.fat bs=1024 count=$(expr 512 \* 1024)
mkfs.vfat testfs.fat
```

You can mount the disk/partition image in Linux to manage the files in it:

```bash
mkdir -p mnt
sudo mount -t vfat testfs.fat mnt
# manage the files, once done, umount
sudo umount mnt
```

### Debug

It is possible to debug the kernel by GDB. See [QEMU GDB Usage](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/gdb.html).

First start QEMU in debug mode by running:

```bash
./qemu.sh debug
```

And then attach GDB to the QEMU instance by:

```bash
gdb -ex "target remote localhost:1234" -ex "symbol-file sysroot/boot/simple_os.kernel"
```

The above loads debug symbols for the kernel, to debug our own bootloader:

```bash
gdb -ex "target remote localhost:1234" -ex "symbol-file bootloader/bootloader.elf" 
```

Note that `bootloader/bootloader.elf` is generated solely to provide the debug symbols. The real bootloader binary is `bootloader/bootloader_padded.bin`.

This debugging trick is also describe in the [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/tree/master/14-checkpoint) for macOS.

### VSCode Integration

Better still, it is possible to do all the above graphically in VSCode.

`.vscode/tasks.json` provide integrated Clean/Build/Emulate task.

You can trigger them in Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

`.vscode/launch.json` provides the debug gdb debug profiles.

Assuming you are running Simple-OS in a remote (virtual) machine, to setup the remote debugging:

1. [How to SSH to a system inside Virtual Box](https://medium.com/nycdev/how-to-ssh-from-a-host-to-a-guest-vm-on-your-local-machine-6cb4c91acc2e)
1. [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension
1. [Native Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug) extension for remote debug through SSH.
1. VSCode extensions [Remote X11](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spadin.remote-x11) and [Remote X11 (SSH)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spadin.remote-x11-ssh) to run QEMU (GUI application) through SSH
    - If your host machine is Windows, then a local X-window server is also needed. You can install [vcxsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).
    - If you SSH into a virtual machine by port forwarding, change `remoteX11.SSH.host` and `remoteX11.SSH.port` in "Remote X11 (SSH)" remote setting (e.g. change to 127.0.0.1 and 5679). Note that the extension does not support password authentication to the remote host, so please add your public key to the serve's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (Ref: [How To Set Up SSH Keys](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2))
    - In Archlinux, X11 forwarding needs to be enabled explicitly, please see [OpenSSH - X11 Forwarding](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/OpenSSH#X11_forwarding)
1. GDB Init Script
    - Copy/Append `.gdbinit` to `~/.gdbinit`. The utility GDB functions defined there will be used in `.vscode/launch.json`.

With all of the setup, the debugging process is streamlined to:

1. Set break points in any source file
1. Trigger `Build` task in Command Palette, make sure it runs successfully
1. Go to VSCode debugger, run `Debug All`
1. A QEMU session will be fired up and the system will run until a break point
1. After finishing debugging, click detach debugger and close the QEMU window

**Note:** Some code in `bootloader/arch/i386/bootloader.asm` and `kernel/arch/i386/boot/boot.asm` can not be debug in this way, please see the comments there.  

## Folder Structure

### Before reading the code

Familiarity with x86 assembly language and C will help you understand the code.

[Tutorialspoint Assembly Programming Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/index.htm) provides a good tutorial for [NASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netwide_Assembler) assembly, which is the assembly dialect we use in this project.

We also use Makefile to automate the compile process. The [Tutorialspoint Unix Makefile Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/makefile/index.htm) is a good introduction.

A one-stop shop for OS development knowledge is the [OsDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page). You can find various useful resources there, and there are bunch of [tutorials](https://wiki.osdev.org/Tutorials) to follow. It is highly recommended to take a look at the [Bare Bones](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) tutorial at OsDev Wiki to get some feeling on how to get started with OS development.

### Bootloader

The `bootloader/` folder contains a standalone bootloader that can load any [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) format kernel binary into memory and kick it started.

Files in the `bootloader/` folder are mostly a combination of pieces scattered across many topics on the OsDev Wiki.

The entry point is at the `boot` label in `bootloader/arch/i386/bootloader.asm`.

The `bootloader/arch/i386/` folder contains various initialization subroutines written in assembly.

- Entering 32-bit [Protected Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_mode):
  - `switch_pm.asm`: [Switch to Protected Mode](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/tree/master/10-32bit-enter).
  - `a20.asm`: Enabling [A20 address line](https://wiki.osdev.org/A20).
  - `gdt.asm`: Initialize the [GDT](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/tree/master/09-32bit-gdt).
- Disk I/O:
  - `disk.asm`: [Read data from disk using BIOS interrupt](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/tree/master/07-bootsector-disk) (works in [Real Mode](https://wiki.osdev.org/Real_Mode)).

- `linker.ld`: [Linker script](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_3.html#SEC6)

Once we finish switching to protected mode, we start to write the remaining part in C.

## Reference

Multiple tutorials have been referenced in the development of this project.

### OS Development Tutorials

1. [OsDev WikiTutorial Series](https://wiki.osdev.org/Tutorials): Very useful starting point of learning OS development. You can start with [Bare Bones](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) and then look into [Meaty Skeleton](https://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton), which we actual use in this project.

1. For tutorial in **Chinese**, I would recommend the [INWOX project](https://github.com/qvjp/INWOX/wiki).

1. [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial): A very user friendly step by step OS dev tutorial. Many files of the bootloader or the kernel are modified from this repo. This tutorial also combines a lot of pieces from some of the following tutorials. In addition, this tutorial assumes a **macOS** environment.

1. [Roll your own toy UNIX-clone OS](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/) a well known tutorial, very concise and easy to understand. You shall read it with the [errata](https://wiki.osdev.org/James_Molloy%27s_Tutorial_Known_Bugs) at hand.

1. [The little book about OS development](http://littleosbook.github.io/#) and [Writing a Simple Operating System - from Scratch](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf). They provide explanation to exemplary code for many OS concepts. They can be used as a complement to the OSDev Wiki.

1. [MIT 6.S081 Operating System Engineering Course](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html). This course provides lecture video this year so it can be seen as a good OS MOOC. It is based on a very popular educational system Xv6, which is a full functioning multi-process OS implemented within 10K lines of code. It will serve as our reference implementation. The course switched to RISC-V architecture in 2019 ([Xv6-RISC](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv)), however for our purpose, the [x86 version](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) will be more useful. It also provides a [functional classification](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/xv6/xv6-rev10.pdf) for each file in the x86 version repo.

1. [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) A very good step by step tutorial on how to build a text application like an editor from scratch. The final product, Kilo, is around 1000 lines of code, and includes features like basic text editing, searching and even C syntax highlighting.
